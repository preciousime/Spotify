Spotify End-to-End Advanced Power BI Project by Injae Park - Watch here: https://lnkd.in/ebyfxEbr.

One aspect I enjoyed while working on this project was the diverse set of tools and techniques outlined by Mohammed Afzal Shariff ( He/Him/His ) in his informative post.

The incorporation of these various tools and techniques made this project fun. From harnessing ChatGPT and Python to generate album cover urls, to utilizing HTML to display these covers, and using DENEB for the creation of heatmaps and unit charts â€“ there was truly no dull moment.

Thanks for such a detailed tutorial Injae Park and thanks Mohammed Afzal Shariff ( He/Him/His ) for sharing your project.

I'd love to know your thoughts about this tutorial and project, and any fun project(s) you have worked on.
